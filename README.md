# Clarity Smart Contracts for Workflow Automation

Various smart contracts written in Clarity to prototype tying tasks from multiple blockchains together in a workflow

## Task and sub-task status for workflow in Clarity 

Prototype for simulating change in a workflow's task or sub-task status

- Typically task and sub-task status is kept in our workflow object model, but this will simulate it as we add the ability to exchange STX for tasks.
- Task status can have one of several states:
-- not used
-- not started
-- in process
-- completed
-- cancelled
- Once a task is completed or cancelled it should not be able to be acted upon
